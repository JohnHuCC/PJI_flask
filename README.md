Based on the machine learning model proposed in preliminary research, this system further develops an efficient pre-diagnosis system for prosthetic joint infections. Utilizing the Random Forest model to interpret the predictions of a stacking model, the system significantly improves its application efficiency in actual medical environments through meticulous numerical adjustments and simplification of decision rules. The system adopts an internet-based architecture, integrates front-end and back-end web application technologies, and leverages Docker container technology for deployment, thereby enhancing the system's portability and scalability.
